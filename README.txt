This is a quick node script to convert a CSV file with a
csv-encoded JSON BLOB "data" column to a JSON file.

To run > node convert.js


See data-out.json for the JSON output.
Change data-in.csv for some other CSV input.

Please note the "data" column is a csv encoded JSON BLOB
that originally came from a database export.
